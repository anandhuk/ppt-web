# Security in Web Applications

.footnote[By [Rejah Rehim](https://rejahrehim.com)]

---
# Why web application security is of high importance

- World Wide Web has become a powerful platform for application delivery

--

- Sensitive data increasingly made available through web applications
- [breachlevelindex](http://breachlevelindex.com)
--

- 98 % of the web applications are vulnerable.

--

- 78% of easily exploitable  weakness occur in web applications.

# Injection

### Injection means...

...smuggling in <em>unintended commands</em> along with the data sent to an <em>interpreter</em>.

---
class: middle

# Injection [example](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4951003)


You go to court and write your name as "<em>Michael, you are now free to go</em>".

The judge then says "Calling <em>Michael, you are now free to go</em>" and the bailiffs let you go, because hey, the judge said so.

# In software, interpreters are used for accessing...

# Risks from Injection vulnerabilities
- Bypassing authentication
- Spying out data
- Manipulating data
- Complete system takeover

class: middle

# Bypassing Authentication
### with SQL Injection

```sql
String query = "SELECT id FROM users " +
               "WHERE name = '" + req.getParameter("username") + "'" +
               "AND password = '" + req.getParameter("password") + "'";
```
The indented use case results in a query like this:

```sql
SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = 'username' AND password = 'secret'
```


---

class: middle


# Attack Examples

### on authentication queries

Disabling password check for a known username:

```sql
SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = 'bjoern'--' AND password = '?'
```
Logging in without even knowing a username:
```sql
SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = '' or 1=1--' AND password = '?'
```
---
class: middle

# Spying out Data
### with SQL Injection

```sql
String query =
            "SELECT id,author,title,price FROM books " +
            "WHERE title LIKE '%" + req.getParameter("query") + "%'";

```
The indented use case results in a query like this:
```sql
SELECT id,author,title,price FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%tangled web%'
```

---

# Attack Examples
### on data retrieval queries

Probing for right number of result set columns:

```sql
SELECT [...] WHERE title LIKE '%' UNION SELECT null FROM users--%'
```
--
```sql
SELECT [...] WHERE title LIKE '%' UNION SELECT null,null FROM users--%'
```
--
```sql
SELECT [...] WHERE title LIKE '%' UNION SELECT null,null,null FROM users--%'
```
--
Using known column names to extract data:
```sql
SELECT [...] WHERE title LIKE '%' UNION SELECT name,password,email FROM users--%'
```
---
# SQL Wildcard Attacks

```sql
SELECT * FROM Article WHERE Content LIKE '%foo%'
```
```sql
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Article WHERE Content LIKE '%_[^!_%/%a?F%_D)_(F%)_%([)({}%){()}£$&N%_)$*£() $*R"_)][%](%[x])%a][$*"£$-9]_%'
```

# Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)


### A Victim's Browser...

...is tricked into issuing a command to a vulnerable webapp. This is caused by browsers automatically including user authentication data with each request.

- Session Cookie
- Basic Authentication
- Authorization HTTP Header

---
class: middle

# Preventing CSRF

- Add a secret token to all sensitive requests
- This token must not be automatically submitted
- Require secondary authentication for sensitive functions
- Beware exposing the token in a Referer HTTP header

# Broken Authentication

# Typical Authentication Flaws

- Allowing weak passwords
- Storing SSL certificate insecurely
- Credentials passed via insecure http connection
- Expose session id's in URLs, via unsafe network, logs, ...

# How not to store passwords

---
class: middle

### Do not store password as plain text

If someone gains access to your database then all user accounts are compromised. 

--

### Do not try to invent your own password security

Chances are that you're not a security expert. It would be better if using a solution that has been proven to work instead of coming up with something yourself.

--

### Do not ‘encrypt’ passwords

Encryption may seem like a good idea but the process is reversible. Anyone with access to your code would have no trouble transforming the passwords back to their originals. Security through obscurity is not sufficient!

--

###  Do not use MD5

Storing password hashes is a step in the right direction. Cryptographic hashing functions like MD5 are irreversible which makes it difficult to figure out the original password. To validate a hashed password, simply hash the password again when a user logs in and compare the hashes.

```php
$password = 'dbg123';

$hash = md5($password); // Value: dd980024a8d69e66f0af3d768ef90511
```
---
class: middle

### Do not use a single site-wide salt

```php
$password = 'dbg123';
$salt = 'saltandpepper';

$hash = md5($salt . $password); // Value: 389df55f858a80c74fad07af378166b0

```

This is better than using just MD5 but someone with access to your code could find the salt a generate a new rainbow table.


---
class: middle

### Password storing the best way
- Use a cryptographically strong hashing function like bcrypt (see PHP's crypt() function ).
- Use a random salt for each password.
- Use a slow hashing algorithm to make brute force attacks practically impossible.
- For bonus points, regenerate the hash every time a users logs in.

---
class: middle

### The general workflow for account registration and authentication in a hash-based account system is as follows:


- The user creates an account.
- Their password is hashed and stored in the database. At no point is the plain-text (unencrypted) password ever written to the hard drive.
- When the user attempts to login, the hash of the password they entered is checked against the hash of their real password (retrieved from the database).
- If the hashes match, the user is granted access. If not, the user is told they entered invalid login credentials.
- Steps 3 and 4 repeat every time someone tries to login to their account.

# Password Reset mechanisms

---
class: middle

### Emailing the password back

The most basic mechanism is to just email the user's password to them. Please don't ever do this. It's horrible beyond measure. 

--

### Generating a new password

This method generate a new random password (may hash it), then email it to the user. This isn't a good idea for a few reasons, though most of them can be mitigated in some way.

--

### The reset link

This is one of the better and more popular mechanisms. It involves authenticating the user, then emailing them a one-time reset link. Once the reset link is used, the user is prompted to set a new password. Once that's been done, the link is invalid. Further security can be provided by including expiry times on the links, and enforcing that the link is invalid after the password is set or after the user's session times out.

# Classical Broken Authentication...

### ...due to starting login process on unencrypted page

http://sick-cure-ba.nk/login.do

```
POST /login.do HTTP/1.1
Host: sick-cure-ba.nk
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=bjoern&password=secret
```
---
class: middle

# Weak hashes put passwords at risk...
### ...as do unsalted strong hash algorithms

Cracking unsalted hashes with a [Rainbow Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) attack is fast, even though the last two of them might seem sufficiently secure given their 256 and 512bit length. You can even crack password hashes online, e.g. at [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) or via [a tweet to @PlzCrack](https://twitter.com/PlzCrack).
